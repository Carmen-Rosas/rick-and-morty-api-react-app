## Rick and Morty info cards
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that you can use to look up info about Rick and Morty characters or locations. It was made with the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
If you click on the character info cards they will expand like this:

And you can also change between characters or locations:
Location info cards do not expand due to lack of information.
